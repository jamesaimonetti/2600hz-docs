The following steps are intending for the majority of LG devices running Android software. 

The first thing you will need to do is ensure that 3G/LTE (if you have an LTE device), voice, and text messaging are all working properly on your device. To do this, a Carrier Wipe, and Profile & PRL update are required. Please follow the steps below. For a number of these updates you'll need your Master Subsidy Lock or MSL--this is a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email; you can also find this information in Device Settings in your 2600hz Mobile account online:

1. Carrier Wipe

Open the dialer
Dial # # 72786 # 
Enter your Master Subsidy Lock (MSL) (a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email) 
Touch "OK", phone will restart
2.  System Update

Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch "About Phone"
Touch “System updates” 
(Note: If it says "No updates available" you may not be connected to the internet. Make sure your WiFi is enabled and connected. You also may need to change your WiFi sleep policy, check it out here)
3. Profile Update
Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates” (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch "Update Profile". The device will restart when complete.
4. PRL Update
Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates" (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch “Update PRL”. Wait for the PRL update to complete, then touch “OK”. Your device may restart after the PRL update. If not, please restart your device.
Once your device restarts, 3G/LTE data, voice, and text messaging should be enabled.
