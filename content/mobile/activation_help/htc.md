The following steps are intending for the majority of HTC devices running Android software. If you have an HTC device running Windows software you should check out these steps. 

The first thing you will need to do is ensure that 3G/LTE (if you have an LTE device), voice, and text messaging are all working properly on your device. To do this, a Carrier Wipe, and Profile & PRL update are required. Please follow the steps below. For a number of these updates you'll need your Master Subsidy Lock or MSL--this is a six-digit code provided to you in your portal; you can also find this information in Device Settings in your portal:

1. Carrier Wipe

Open the dialer
Dial # # 72786 # 
Enter your Master Subsidy Lock (MSL) (a six digit code provided to you in your portal) 
Press the "MENU" key
Select "Reset"
The phone will then powercycle
2.  System Update

Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates” (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
(Note: If it says "No updates available" you may not be connected to the internet. Make sure your WiFi is enabled and connected. You also may need to change your WiFi sleep policy, check it out here)
3. Profile Update
Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates” (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch "Update Profile". The device will restart when complete.
4. PRL Update
Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates" (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch “Update PRL”. Wait for the PRL update to complete, then touch “OK”. Your device may restart after the PRL update. If not, please restart your device.
Once your device restarts, 3G/LTE data, voice, and text messaging should be enabled.

4G WiMax Settings
*for 4G LTE devices, no further action is required*

Once your HTC device is confirmed to be activated and you have voice, text messaging and 3G data working, you’ll need to manually program your 4G WiMax settings to be able to access 4G data speeds.
Open the dialer
Dial # #3282# (# #DATA#) 
Touch "Edit Mode" 
Enter your Master Subsidy Lock (MSL) (a six-digit code provided to you in your portal) and touch "OK" 
Touch "Advanced"
Touch "WiMAX" 
Touch "Realm" 
Enter "mvno102.sprintpcs.com" and touch "OK" 
Press the "MENU" key 
Touch "Commit Modifications" 
Phone will reboot on its own
Once the phone restarts, assuming you are in a 4g/WiMax area, you should be able to use 4G data.
