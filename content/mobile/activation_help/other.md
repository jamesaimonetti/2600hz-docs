While we can't provide specific instructions for all devices or all manufacturers, we do have some generic steps you can try complete the activation on the 2600hz Mobile network. Menu names and structures may vary on your device.

The first thing you will need to do is ensure that voice, and text messaging are all working properly on your device. To do this, a Carrier Wipe, and Profile & PRL update may be required. Some of the steps below will require your MSL and MSID; these are in the activation email that you received from 2600hz Mobile. You can also find this information in the Device Settings of your 2600hz Mobile account online. Please follow the steps below:

1. Carrier Wipe for Feature Phones

Open the dialer
Dial ##MSL# (The MSL is a 6 digit number emailed to you by 2600hz Mobile upon the activation of your handset)
Touch Edit
Enter your 10 digit phone number
*NOTE even if the 10 digit phone number is already listed, you should still backspace it and re enter it. 
Touch "OK"
Clear all the zeroes and enter the MSID number (received in the email by 2600hz Mobile upon activation of your handset)
Touch "OK"
Touch "Done", the phone will reboot (if it does not reboot, do so manually)
If you have a smartphone, the instructions above may not apply. The following generic instructions may apply to your device, although menu names and structures may vary.

1. Carrier Wipe

Open the dialer
Dial # # 72786 #
Enter your Master Subsidy Lock (MSL) (a 6 digit number emailed to you by 2600hz Mobile upon the activation of your handset)
Touch "OK", phone will restart
2. System Update

Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates” (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
(Note: If it says "No updates available" you may not be connected to the internet. Make sure your WiFi is enabled and connected. You also may need to change your WiFi sleep policy, check it out here)
3. Profile Update

Touch the “Application” icon

Once your device restarts, 3G data, voice, and text messaging should be enabled. If your device supports picture messaging, you should follow the additional steps below.

If the steps above have still not helped in activating your device we suggest the follow:

On your device enter ##MSL# (The MSL number is in the email)
Select Edit
Enter your phone number and hit "OK"
