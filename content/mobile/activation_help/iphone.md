The following final activation steps are intended for the iPhone 4, 4S and 5 running any iOS.

After the phone has been added to your account:

Connect to a Wi-Fi network
Restart your phone
Within 2-3 minutes the phone should start a Hands Free Activation on its own
When the activation completes, your phone is ready for use
If your phone does not start working immediately, follow the steps below.
1. Check the MEID number and confirm that it's the same as the one listed in your 2600hz Mobile account. To find the MEID on your phone:

Tap the Settings app
Tap General
Tap About
Look for the MEID - do not confuse this with the IMEI
Look for ICCID and make sure it's correct (iPhone 5 only)
NOTE: Your MEID will be listed in the hex form on your phone; it's listed in both forms in your 2600hz Mobile account on your Device Settings page underneath the picture of the phone.


 

2. Make sure you're not in a roaming area.

3. Make sure that voice and data are enabled on your 2600hz Mobile account.

4. Make sure that data is enabled on your phone. To confirm this:

Tap the Settings app
Tap Cellular (on iOS 6, tap General, then Cellular)
Make sure the ON/OFF button for Cellular Data is in the ON position
 


 

5. Try running a network reset:

Tap the Settings app
Tap General
Tap Reset
Tap Reset Network Settings
6. Try running a profile update:

Connect to a Wi-Fi network
Tap the phone app
Dial # # 873283 #
Tap Call
Starting Service Update message will appear - tap OK
If update is successful Service Update Complete message will appear after about a minute - tap OK
**If update is not successful Service Update Fails message will appear, make sure you are connected to a Wi-Fi network and try again; if this happens again try running a factory reset.

**If the update is successful but you only have voice/text and not data, try running a factory reset.

7. Wait 3-6 hours. Some users have found that waiting 3-6 hours after attempting activation gives the phone sufficient time to connect to the network and the phone activates on its own during this time. If your profile update was successful but you still aren't able to activate, it may help to wait a few hours prior to trying a factory reset.

Factory Reset
If you've tried all of the steps above and your phone is still not activating, you'll need to run a factory reset.

Factory Reset

Back up your phone
Tap the Settings app
Tap General
Tap Reset
Tap Erase All Content and Settings
Enter your passcode if prompted
Erase iPhone
Erase iPhone
The phone will reboot and you will be prompted to set up your phone again, which you can do as a new device or restore it from a previous backup in iTunes or iCloud.

Picture Messaging Settings
The following steps will allow your phone to send and receive mms messages between your iPhone and other non-Apple devices

Ensure that "Can send picture and video messages" is enabled for the phone on your 2600hz Mobile account
Once mms messaging has been enabled on the account, wait 6 hours (if you've already had it enabled for more than 6 hours, move on to the next step)
Restart your phone
If mms messaging still isn't working on your phone, run a profile update:

Connect to a Wi-Fi network
Tap the phone app
Dial # # 873283 #
Tap Call
Starting Service Update message will appear - tap OK
If update is successful Service Update Complete message will appear after about a minute - tap OK
If mms messaging still isn't working on your phone, run a factory reset:
