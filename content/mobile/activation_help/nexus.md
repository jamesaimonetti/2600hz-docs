These instructions are specifically for Samsung Nexus devices. Instructions for other types of Samsung devices can be found here.

The first thing you will need to do is ensure that 3G and LTE data (if supported), voice, and text messaging are all working properly on your device. To do this, a Carrier Wipe, and Profile & PRL update are required. Please follow the steps below. For a number of these updates you'll need your Master Subsidy Lock or MSL--this is a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email; you can also find this information in Device Settings in your 2600hz Mobile account online:

1. Carrier Wipe

Open the dialer
Dial *#*#72786#*#*
Enter your Master Subsidy Lock (MSL) (a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email)
Touch "OK", phone will restart
2.  System Update

Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch "About Phone" 
Touch “System updates” (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
(Note: If it says "No updates available" you may not be connected to the internet. Make sure your WiFi is enabled and connected. You also may need to change your WiFi sleep policy, check it out here)
3. Profile Update
Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch "About Phone" 
Touch “Sprint®* System updates” (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch "Update Profile". The device will restart when complete.
4. PRL Update
Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch "About Phone"
Touch “ Sprint System updates" (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch “Update PRL”. Wait for the PRL update to complete, then touch “OK”. Your device may restart after the PRL update. If not, please restart your device.
Once your device restarts, 3G/LTE data, voice, and text messaging should be enabled.

4G WiMax Settings
*for 4G LTE devices, no further action is required*

Once your Samsung device is confirmed to be activated and you have voice, text messaging and 3G data working, you’ll need to manually program your 4G WiMax settings to be able to access 4G data speeds.
Open the dialer
Dial *#*#3282#*#* (*#*#DATA#*#*)
Touch "View"
Touch "WiMax"
Enter your MSL (a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email) and touch "Ok"
Touch "Realm"
Touch the “Menu” button
Touch “Write RLM”
Enter “mvno102.sprintpcs.com” and touch "Ok"
Restart phone
Once the phone restarts, assuming you are in a 4G capable area, you should be able to use 4G data.

Your MSL code will be emailed to you, but it can also be found in your 2600hz Mobile account under the Device Settings tab. Click the phone number of the device in question and the MSL will be displayed on the left-hand side.
