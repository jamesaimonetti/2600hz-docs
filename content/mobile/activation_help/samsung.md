The following steps are intending for the majority of Samsung devices running Android software. There are two exceptions:

1. The Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus require different instructions which can be found here.

2. Samsung Feature phones may require different instructions, however, we recommend trying the steps below before moving on. 

The first thing you will need to do is ensure that 3G/LTE (if you have an LTE device), voice, and text messaging are all working properly on your device. To do this, a Carrier Wipe, and Profile & PRL update are required. Please follow the steps below. For a number of these updates you'll need your Master Subsidy Lock or MSL--this is a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email; you can also find this information in Device Settings in your 2600hz Mobile account online:

1. Carrier Wipe

NOTE:  Galaxy Note IIs running Android 4.3 may reset to factory defaults after a carrier reset - back up your device first!

Open the dialer
Dial # # 72786 # 
Enter your Master Subsidy Lock (MSL) (a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email) if prompted 
Touch "OK", phone will restart
2.  System Update

Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates” (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
(Note: If it says "No updates available" you may not be connected to the internet. Make sure your WiFi is enabled and connected. You also may need to change your WiFi sleep policy, check it out here)
3. Profile Update
Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates” (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch "Update Profile". The device will restart when complete.
4. PRL Update
Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates" (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch “Update PRL”. Wait for the PRL update to complete, then touch “OK”. Your device may restart after the PRL update. If not, please restart your device.
Once your device restarts, 3G/LTE data, voice, and text messaging should be enabled.

4G WiMax Settings
*for 4G LTE devices, no additional action is required*

Once your Samsung device is confirmed to be activated and you have voice, text messaging and 3G data working, you’ll need to manually program your 4G WiMax settings to be able to access 4G data speeds.
Open the dialer
Dial # #3282# (# #DATA#) 
Touch "View"
Touch "WiMax"
Enter your MSL (a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email) and touch "OK"
Touch "Realm"
Press the hardware menu button (The page button located on handset in the bottom left corner of the device)
Touch "Write Rlm"
Enter "mvno102.sprintpcs.com" and touch "Save" (Note: It will only say "Realm: sprintpcs.com" in this field)
Restart Phone
Once the phone restarts, assuming you are in a 4G capable area, you should be able to use 4G data.
