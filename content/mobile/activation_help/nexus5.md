Before you begin these final activation steps for the LG Google Nexus 5, you must already have done these steps.

Make sure you have your 6-digit master subsidy lock or MSL on hand before you get started, as you'll need this for some of the programming steps below. This would have been e-mailed to you when you activated your phone online and you can also find it in the Device Settings in your 2600hz Mobile account.

1. Carrier Wipe

Open the dialer
Dial *#*#72786#*#*
Phone will restart and will indicate that it's Activating and that it may take up to 5 minutes
 

2. Profile Update

Please note - profile updates will reset Network Mode to Global rather than LTE or 3G. If you have already set these, you will need to reset them.

Tap the Application icon
Tap Settings
Tap More...
Tap Mobile networks
Tap Carrier settings
Tap Update profile
Once the update is complete, tap OK
 

3. PRL Update

Tap the Application icon
Tap Settings
Tap More...
Tap Mobile networks
Tap Carrier settings
Tap Update PRL
Once the update is complete, tap OK
If your device does not restart after the PRL update, restart it. Voice, text, 3G and LTE data should now be working. If you want to use picture messaging make sure to log in to your 2600hz Mobile account online and check the option Can receive picture and video messages.

Troubleshooting Activation
If you're having trouble getting activated:

Tap the phone app and then the dialpad icon
Dial *#*#3282#*#* (*#*#DATA#*#*)
Touch "More"
Touch "eHRPD"
Turn off
Restart phone
Confirm data is enabled in the phone's settings and then check if it's working
If data is working turn eHRPD back on
If this doesn't work try going through steps 1 - 7 above, and then do the following:

Enable LTE (LTE/CDMA) on the phone in the network mode
Run a carrier reset
Re-enable eHRPD
If you're still unable to activate, try running a factory reset on the phone:

Tap the Settings app
Tap "Backup & reset"
Enable "Back up my data" and "Automatic Restore if applicable"
Tap "Factory data reset"
Tap "Reset phone"
Tap "Erase everything"
If you have tried all of the steps above with no success and you're still unable to activate your device, please get in touch with us so we can help you out.

 

A Note About LTE Data
The Nexus 5 is a tri-band LTE device, but not all LTE markets have been upgraded tri-band LTE yet. In those areas only 3G data will be available for tri-band devices.
