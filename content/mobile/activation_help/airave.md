Set Up
Disconnect the power from all devices on your network including the cable or DSL modem and router.
Place the Airave close to a window and somewhere centrally located preferably elevated.
Connect one end of the ethernet cable to the available LAN port on your modem and the other end of the ethernet connection t the Airave WAN port.
Turn on your modem
Wait a couple of minutes for the modem to fully initialize before continuing set up
Plug the power supply connector into the back of the Airave.
Plug the other end into an electrical outlet.
External GPS Antenna Setup: (Use this if your Airave's internal antenna doesn't get a signal for GPS lock. This is indicated by a SOLID RED GPS LED for more than 40 minutes. SOLID GREEN indicates GPS lock.)

Before trying the External setup, it takes about 30-40 minutes for the Airave to get a GPS fix after initial setup.

Remove the GPS antenna module from the back of the Airave. Connect the GPS cord to the antenna module and the Airave.
Place the external GPS antenna horizontally on a flat surface as close to a window as possible. The antenna works best in an open area where it can easily pick up signals
Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting Activation

If you're unable to get your recently activated Airave working, go through the following steps:

Unplug all cables and power cords from all devices (Airave, modem, router) in any order
Connect all ethernet and GPS cables/antenna
DON'T connect any power cords at this point
Plug the Airave into an electrical outlet
Wait 4 minutes
Plug your cable or DSL modem into an electrical outlet
 

Resetting an Airave

If an Airave has been working, problem-free and stops working, try resetting it.

Use a paper clip or pin to push and hold the Reset button for at least 10 seconds.
Wait 30-45 minutes
The Airave will go through an automated sequence during which the device's LEDs will be sold for a few seconds and then all LEDs will turn off until the software loads.
