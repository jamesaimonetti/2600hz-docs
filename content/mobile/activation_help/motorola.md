The following steps are intending for the majority of Motorola devices running Android software. 

The first thing you will need to do is ensure that 3G/LTE (if you have an LTE device), voice, and text messaging are all working properly on your device. To do this, a Carrier Wipe, and Profile & PRL update are required. Please follow the steps below. For a number of these updates you'll need your Master Subsidy Lock or MSL--this is a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email; you can also find this information in Device Settings in your 2600hz Mobile account online:

1. Carrier Wipe

Open the dialer
Dial # # 72786 # 
Enter your Master Subsidy Lock (MSL) (a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email) 
Touch "Yes", phone will restart
2.  System Update

Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates” (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch "Update Software"
(Note: If it says "No updates available" you may not be connected to the internet. Make sure your WiFi is enabled and connected. You also may need to change your WiFi sleep policy, check it out here)
3. Profile Update
Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates” (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch "Update Profile". The device will restart when complete.
4. PRL Update
Touch the “Application” icon
Touch “Settings”
Touch “System updates" (on some newer phones, this may be one level up from the Settings menu)
Touch “Update PRL”. Wait for the PRL update to complete, then touch “OK”. Your device may restart after the PRL update. If not, please restart your device.
Once your device restarts, 3G/LTE data, voice, and text messaging should be enabled.

4G WiMax Settings
*for 4G LTE devices, no further action is required*

Once your Motorola device is confirmed to be activated and you have voice, text messaging and 3G data working, you’ll need to manually program your 4G WiMax settings to be able to access 4G data speeds.
Open the dialer. 
Dial # #3282# (##DATA#) from the dialer
Touch "Wimax"
Press the Applications button on your handset (The four squares, located at the bottom left of the phone)
Touch “Edit”
Enter your Master Subsidy Lock (MSL)  (a six-digit code provided to you by 2600hz Mobile in your activation email) and touch “Verify”
Scroll down to "Realm"
Enter “mvno102.sprintpcs.com”
Touch “Done”
Restart Device
Once the phone restarts, you should be able to send and receive picture messages. Assuming you are in a 4G capable data area, your 4G data should also be enabled (ensure it is turned on through your phones settings).
