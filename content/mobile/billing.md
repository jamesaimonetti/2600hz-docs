## How does Billing Work?

- Voice
- SMS
- MMS
- Data
- Taxes
Can you provide some details on how mobile billing will be handled? I'm implementing a new billing system and would like to build this in sooner rather than later. If you have CDR available showing all of the different billing items (data, minutes, SMS, etc. etc.) that would be really helpful.

- International Usage
- Roaming
- VoIP Overlayed Numbers

No

Do offer any discounts on volume orders?
