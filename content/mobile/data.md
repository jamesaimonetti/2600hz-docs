What is the difference in data speeds for 3G, 4G WiMax and 4G LTE?

We do not cap data speeds - the speeds vary based on cell tower, coverage and location. Sprint offers 3G which is a slower technology and two flavors of 4G - one called WiMax and one called LTE. WiMax was the initial Sprint offering which is slowly being phased out for the more supported LTE standard.
