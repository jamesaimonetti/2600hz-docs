Today he asked about the "ability to see, control, modify, intercept SMS messages that are sent to/from the mobile devices?"

Move active call across devices
Will be available in Jan 2014.

Call recording across devices
This works the same way as for a VoIP phone.

Seamless call transfer
Your VoIP phones can seamlessly transfer calls to mobile phones using extension numbers, just as they do other desk numbers. We will be adding functionality to use * codes from the mobile phone to transfer calls from the mobile phone back to a landline, ATA or VoIP phone.

Presence indicator
Simply map the SIP username that belongs to the mobile device to a BLF key on another phone and you'll be able to see when the mobile user is on the phone.

Real time location tracking

Can I receive voicemails to text?

No, not at this time.

How does mobile integrate with Kazoo?

Your mobile phone literally acts like a VoIP phone. You can dial extension numbers, call out with whatever Caller ID you like, have call flows route the way you want, record calls, use menus, etc.

There are three exceptions:
* All extension dialing must be at least 4 digits. Sprint does not send 3 or less digits back to us
* 911 is handled by Sprint exclusively and does not utilize our E911 services
* 0, 411 and codes starting with a * are not configurable

Can I use mobile APIs?

These are still pending, but we are very close.

Do you have a UI specifically for mobile?

The UI is the existing Kazoo User Interface
