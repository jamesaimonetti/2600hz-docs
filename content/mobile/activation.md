## Device Activation
How Do I Activate My Device/ Service?

Buying via our Partner Program

Once you've acquired your device and it arrives, create a dummy VoIP Phone in the account/sub-account where you want the mobile phone attached. All you have to do after that is fill out your information here, and we'll take care of the rest.

We will then activate and pair your mobile phone, just as if it was a VoIP Phone, with the phone in your account. You can then manage the phone via callflows just like you would a regular VoIP phone.

Buying via our Wholesale Program

Wholesale is simple, all you have to do is visit here. That's it, just fill out the form and we'll help you from there.




# Device Activation

## Activate on the Network
First, you need to tell the cellular towers to authorize use of your device. Use the GUI to activate the device, or our APIs. You'll need to provide your ESN, an optional ICC ID and your ZIP code.
During this process you'll be assigned a new cellular phone number (don't worry if you don't want that as your final number).

When activation is complete, you'll be assigned an MSL code. Please write down this code and also note that it's available on your "information" tab in the Mobile GUI.
You'll need this code to reset your phone.


## Activate the Device
Next, you'll need to tell the device itself to pickup it's new phone number and configuration information.

For best results, most phones will try to download activation over WiFi if there is a configured WiFi network. Otherwise, they'll try via 3G and LTE.
