## Not Receiving SMS / MMS Messages on iPhone
You are not receiving SMS / MMS because your phone is still registered on iMessage.

Here’s how to fix it.

Disabling iMessage
    
If you're making the leap from iPhone to another type of device like an Android or Windows phone, but planning to keep your phone number, you'll need to make sure to disable iMessage so that your number is no longer registered for iMessaging. You'll know you need to disable iMessage if you're experiencing any of the following:

* You can't receive messages from friends with iPhones
* You can't send messages to people with non-Apple devices
* SMS messages sent to your number are going to your old iPhone or other registered Apple device
To correct this you need to simply disable iMessage on your device or unregister your device in your Apple ID account.


Disabling iMessage on your phone
If you plan to sell, trade in or otherwise give away your iPhone, it's definitely easier to simply disable iMessage while you still have it. You can do this over WiFi if you’ve already de-activated the phone.

1. Make sure that Wifi or data is enabled on your phone. If the phone is not connected to the Internet, the change you're making won't sync with the iMessage registration system.
 
2. Now go to Settings  Messages  iMessage and tap the on/off button.


If you’ve already gotten rid of your iPhone… Disabling iMessage from your Apple ID account
If you no longer have the iPhone in your hot little hands, then you'll need to unregister your iPhone from your Apple ID account.
 
1. Go to  supportprofile.apple.com/MySupportProfile.do and login.

2. Under My Products select the phone that you want to remove from the registration system.

3. Click Unregister. You'll see a message asking if your are sure; go ahead and click Unregister again. Now your number is no longer registered with iMessage, your Apple ID or the App Store.

4. Text "Stop" to 48369. This last step has helped folks who did the first three steps but were still having SMS issues.
