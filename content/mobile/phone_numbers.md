How many numbers I can attach to the mobile device?

You can attach as many as you like. However, only the primary mobile number will be able to send and receive SMS and MMS messages. We will be releasing a mobile app later to allow for selecting this on the fly.

Does all voice, video, sms and data work for all attached numbers?

No, see above. Only the primary number is enabled for SMS.

Can I dial extensions from mobile?

Yes, as long as they are four digits in length or more.

How can I add my office number to mobile number?

Simply attach your mobile device to your user, and make sure your office callflow rings your user. It will inherently ring all your phones, including your mobile.

Can I have my personal number as a primary number and Office number as secondary?

Yes, in fact most people don't send/receive MMS and SMS messages via their office number, so this is our recommended setup - your personal number is your primary and your office number is your secondary.
