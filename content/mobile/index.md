## Your Very Own Private Mobile Network

Welcome to 2600hz Mobile.

Build apps on a mobile network that you can bundle, integrate and control. 100% API driven mobile networks. What will you build?


## What is 2600hz Mobile?

2600hz Mobile is a combination of software APIs and mobile services offered by 2600hz. On the software side, we offer APIs that you can use to manage mobile services over various wireless carriers. On the network side, we offer pre-built integrations with carriers such as Sprint. We even offer the ability to tie in your own cellular towers using OpenBTS from Range Networks.


## How Does It Work?

As of today, we have publicly announced an integration with Sprint's wireless towers and the ability to provision Sprint-branded handsets. With this integration, you can buy new or used Sprint handsets and use our APIs or web management GUI to activate phones. Then, you can route voice calls to your own infrastructure or to our hosted platform to overlay additional features. In addition, you can control pieces of data and SMS signaling as well.

With this integration, you can add corporate and enterprise features to customer's existing phone experience, all without apps or bad VoIP call quality over data. You can record calls, transfer calls, extension dial, manipulate Caller ID and more through our existing APIs - and all those features will apply to your customer's cellular experience.

## How Do I Get Started?

At this time, the only way to utilize 2600hz Mobile is to get an approved account from our sales team. Please contact sales@2600hz.com to access this service.

## Will the service be open to everyone?

At some point in the near future we will open services up to everyone. People who need support will be required to meet a monthly minimum.
