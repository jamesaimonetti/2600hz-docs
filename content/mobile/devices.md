How Do I Order Service/ Phones?

There are two ways to buy service

Bring Your Own Device

Our service is unique in that we allow you to re-activate devices which are older than 1 year old and have been inactive. These devices can be re-activated and used - you can buy them off eBay or elsewhere, as long as they are Sprint phones with a "Clean ESN" (meaning they were not previously lost/stolen or flagged for some other reason).

Used devices from Glyde


Purchase a New Device

We can sell you any phone advertised on the Sprint website at full, unsubsidized retail prices with the exception of iPhone and Blackberry units. As of January, 2014, you'll be able to pay for those devices over a six or twelve month period if you don't want to pay for it all at once. Once you've purchased the device, you own it - if you want to switch carriers later, there's no contracts and nothing holding you back.

What kind of phones are eligible on 2600hz service?

Any regular contract Sprint phone on 3G, 4G LTE, 4G WiMax that is not a Blackberry or an iPhone and is currently supported for new activations by Sprint. You can not, however, utilize Sprint pre-paid phones or phones from Sprint's other MVNOs like Boost or Virgin Mobile.

Where can I buy eligible devices from?

For Bring Your Own Device phones, we recommend trying eBay - but make sure you have a 14-day or more return policy from the seller just in case we have trouble activating the phone.

For new phones, you can purchase them from us. Contact sales for more info and we'll help you out.

Can I buy it from the Sprint website?

Sprint requires new contracts with their phones sold via their website (except Pre-pay). So, no, you can't do that unfortunately.

Can I see the list of devices you offer?

We recommend the Nexus 5 from Google because it has virtually every band you'll need if you travel internationally plus a lot of really great features at an affordable price point. If you don't want a nexus there are a bunch of other great devices like the Galaxy S3 or Galaxy Note 2. The following list contains phones that are NOT eligible at the moment:

- HTC One
- HTC 8XT
- Kyocera HydroEDGE
- LG Optimus F3
- LG G2
- Motorola X 1056
- Samsung Galaxy Note 3
- Samsung ATIV S Neo
- Samsung Galaxy S4
- Samsung Tab 3
- Samsung L520 (S4 Mini)
- Samsung Galaxy Mega L600
- ZTE Sprint Vital
- ZTE Awe (Nex) N800



What does "refurbished" mean? Refurbished devices are lightly used devices that have been returned or have had small issues requiring simple repair. As such, they're much cheaper than they'd be if purchased brand new. Refurbished devices may not include a manual or microSD card.

When I receive my refurbished device from 2600hz Mobile, can I just activate and go? Yes. Just hit the activation page and we'll walk you through the simple activation process.



Where do Glyde's used devices come from? 
The used devices that are available through the 2600hz Mobile used marketplace come from our partnership with Glyde.




Do I get a warranty with my used device from Glyde? 
No. All devices from Glyde are sold as-is.

That said, if the device you receive isn't as-advertised, you have 48 hours to let Glyde know. They'll send you a return shipping package, which you can use to pack up the device and return it. You'll be refunded the full purchase price once the seller acknowledges receipt of the return.





Can I move my existing phone number to a used device? Absolutely. If you're moving from another carrier to 2600hz Mobile you have the option to "port" (bring) your number along. If you're upgrading your 2600hz Mobile device just give us a shout when you get your phone and we'll move the number to your new phone for you. 1-855-846-4389.




What kinds of devices can I bring to 2600hz Mobile? 
Our program is as follows: Bring your used, inactive SprintÂ® device to 2600hz Mobile, and activate it with a 2600hz Mobile service plan*.

Newer smartphones like the S4 and the HTC One cannot be brought over. Likewise, BlackBerry and Push-to-Talk (PTT) devices cannot make the move.

Please check the Bring Your Own Device to 2600hz Mobile whitelist to see if your device is eligible and can come to 2600hz Mobile. If you have the device on hand, you can use our eligibility checker above to see it can be brought over.




Can I bring an unlocked device to 2600hz Mobile? An "unlocked device" is typically a GSM device and is not compatible with 2600hz Mobile. Unlocked devices, and devices from T-Mobile, Verizon or AT&T cannot be brought over to 2600hz Mobile.




How does the Bring Your Own Device to 2600hz Mobile process work? 
You visit 2600hz.com/mobile and enter your ESN/MEID.
We check your ESN's eligibility and 'bring it over' to 2600hz Mobile
Activate your device with 2600hz Mobile.
You follow the steps on your phone to complete your activation.





What is the "whitelist"? The whitelist is a list of all phone models that are eligible to come over to 2600hz Mobile. Currently there are several hundred whitelisted phones, please be sure to consult this list prior to making any device purchases.




How long does the Bring Your Own Device to 2600hz Mobile process take? The time it takes to bring your device to 2600hz Mobile varies. Generally, the process takes around two to three hours.





Can I use my device during the Bring Your Own Device to 2600hz Mobile process? 
No. Your device must be inactive before you begin the process.




How do I find my device's ESN/MEID? 
With most devices, the ESN/MEID is at the back of the handset, underneath the battery. The ESN/MEID is normally an 18-digit number labelled DEC and starting with 256, 268, or 270. On some older phones and data devices, the ESN/MEID is an 11-digit number, often beginning with 096.

If your device does not have a removable battery, or if your ESN/MEID is not located behind your battery you can discover it through your device's settings (most likely in the "About Phone" menu).




I received an error that my device has been flagged as lost or stolen. What now? 
If a device has been flagged as lost or stolen, we will be unable to activate the device.

If you are the original device owner and you believe the device has been flagged in error, you should contact your previous carrier to have this flag removed. If this is a device you purchased through Glyde or another third party, you should contact the seller immediately to attempt to return it and get your money back.





My device has gone through the Bring Your Own Device to 2600hz Mobile process but is still not working. 
There are a couple of things you will manually need to change to activate your device. Please make sure you've gone through the steps to complete your activation. In most cases, these steps will resolve most issues.
