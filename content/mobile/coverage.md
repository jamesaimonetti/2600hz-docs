## Coverage on the 2600hz Mobile Network

2600hz Mobile wireless network services are provided on the Nationwide Sprint Network*. 2600hz Mobile customers have access to voice and data service that covers more than 282 million people.

What can I expect in terms of signal strength and coverage from 2600hz Mobile? 
The map above is a strong indication of what you can expect from 2600hz Mobile. You will generally experience good reception in areas listed as "Good" or "Best" in the map above. You may experience weaker reception in other areas.

We also suggest that all new customers have a look at third party coverage maps. Here are a couple we recommend: Sensorly, RootMetrics, and Open Signal




## Roaming

Does 2600hz Mobile charge domestic roaming fees? 
No! 2600hz Mobile does not charge any additional fees for domestic voice roaming (although you may see a roaming indicator on your phone in some locations).

Currently 2600hz Mobile does not offer domestic data roaming.


## International Roaming

What about international coverage? If you are planning to use your phone outside of the USA you should check out these two pages outlining our coverage and rates: Traveling outside the USA & International Calling


## Device Type and Coverage

Does my device type affect my coverage? Yes. Certain phones and devices will have a stronger antenna than others, which will definitely play a role in the signal strength you receive. We recommend researching our various devices to determine which one will fit your needs.

What is your international roaming coverage?
How does roaming work?

Roaming happens when the radios in your phone can't find a Sprint signal or the Sprint signal is very poor, and the phone tries to utilize a different provider like Verizon instead. Unfortunately, these alternative providers charge a TON of money when this happens. Therefore, we disable roaming by default.

How do I activate roaming?

You need to sign a contract and put a deposit on your account to cover potential abuse. Then, we'll activate roaming. The contract simply states you won't abuse the service and provides us information about you in case there's an issue.

How do I check coverage?

I'm in an area with no coverage. Can I sign up for 2600hz Mobile?

We are prototyping femto-cells that will allow you to connect a mini cell tower in your home/business to your internet connection and then utilize our service. This allows you coverage in that location. It is not useful if your entire town or city is not covered but it is very useful if you just have some dead spots with Sprint. Please contact us if you'd like to participate in this beta.

Does 2600hz Charge for nation-wide roaming?

"Roaming" within the Sprint network domestically is free.

Roaming on other carriers is disabled by default due to fraud risk. Based on usage patterns in our initial testing, we likely won't charge any additional fees for domestic voice roaming in the future as long as it remains under 5% of your total usage (although you may see a roaming indicator on your phone in some locations).

What is your international roaming coverage?

Our phones can roam in Mexico, Canada and in some locations overseas. Again, this is via other carriers and tends to be very expensive. It requires the same contract and deposit policy be adhered to just like above for US roaming. Over time we anticipate that we will be involved in business relationships with multiple operators abroad, but we have no timelines or firm information to report.


## I'm in an area with no coverage. Can I sign up for 2600hz Mobile? 
YES! You can use an AirRave + WiFi calling.

Unfortunately, there are some areas in the USA where we're unable to provide service. If your address falls outside of our coverage area, you will be unable to sign up for 2600hz Mobile.





What are tri-band LTE devices?
These are devices that use a newer kind of technology that allows the both 3G and LTE data to be accessed from the same radio. The 2600hz Mobile devices (purchased and BYOD) that use this type of technology are:

Samsung Galaxy Note 3
LG Google Nexus 5
LG G2
Samsung Galaxy Mega
Samsung Galaxy Tab 3
Samsung S4 Mini
Netgear 341U, Zing (hotspots)
Spencer MiFi (hotspot)
Why does this matter?
The network is currently undergoing upgrades to handle these devices, but the roll out is not complete. The result is that LTE data may not be available for customers using these devices in some markets.

How do I know if I will be affected?
The first thing to make sure of is whether or not you are currently in an LTE market. You can determine that using the map on this page.

If you are in an area that shows LTE on that map, you can get in touch with us so we can check into it for you.

We'll be able to let you know if you fall into an area that definitely has tri-band LTE or if you're in an area where the roll out hasn't been completed yet. Currently we won't be able to give you any firm timelines on when the roll out will be completed in your area.

What should I do if tri-band LTE is not available in my area yet?
The best thing to do is to set your phone to CDMA only rather than LTE or LTE/CDMA. This will at least allow you to access 3G data without affecting your voice/text services.

When can I expect to get tri-band LTE?
We don't have any firm dates on that yet, but we will continue to update this article as we get more information.

What is an Airave?
The Airave is a device that uses your internet connection to improve your cellular signal. It's like having a mini cell tower of your own.


Why would I want an Airave?
If you live in an area that doesn't have great coverage or if the building you are in interferes with your cellular signal, the Airave can help with that.

Can I use an Airave anywhere?

How many devices can I connect to the Airave at once?
Airaves supported by 2600hz Mobile can have up to 5 devices connected at once.

How can I test that I'm connected to my Airave?
Calling *99 will prompt a message confirming that you are connected to an Airave. In addition, you will hear three short beeps before you make or receive any calls.

What kind of coverage can I expect from the Airave and can it be increased?
By default Airaves cover up to 5,000 square feet, depending on the building type, but if you want to increase that range, just contact us with your Airave's MAC ID and weâ€™ll be happy to help you out.

Is there a monthly device fee to have the Airave?
No, there is no monthly device fee associated with the Airave.

Are phone calls made using the Airave free since it uses my internet connection?
No. Calls made using the Airave are billed just like any other call because you're still connecting to the cellular network. The Airave just improves your signal.

Where can I get an Airave?
You can purchase one from 2600hz Mobile, but if we're out of stock, you can bring your own Airave. Just make sure of the following:

Airvana brand
version 2.0 or 2.5
MAC ID begins with 0005B
must be inactive
How do I BYOD an Airave?
We'll help you out with that. Just contact us with your Airave's MAC ID (should start with 0005B).
