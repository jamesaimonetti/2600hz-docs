## Transferring a Number In

First, activate the device. You'll get a temporary number.
Then, initiate a port-in request. You'll be asked some stuff.
Finally, you'll be notified if the port is successful or fails.


## Transferring a Number Out

### Moving to Another Provider


### Converting Number to VoIP as Primary
When you port a number out, you cancel the phone.
You can re-activate the phone afterward but it will need a new phone number.

How to port numbers over? How long does it take?

If you'd like to port your number, please follow the same instructions as listed above for activating a new phone - except include some additional details:

- Your old phone number
- Your old account number
- Your PIN from your old account, if any
- Your old account's billing address
- Your social security number or Tax ID, if available
- The date you'd like the number to port. Most numbers port at 11:00am CST on the date requested. All ports occur during business hours only - no holidays or weekends.

What if I am already a Sprint user?

You can change to our service via the same porting procedure above. However, Sprint forbids us from moving already active devices on the Sprint network to our service.

Where/ how can I see my usage?

At this time we are only billing flat-rate plans because we are still finalizing our usage-based strategy. We will, at some point in the future, have usage-based plans, but not yet. For wholesale customers, you will be on a post-paid contract and we will bill you at the end of the month for your usage.

Where do I check number transfer status?

To check your status on a port, check the user interface for Kazoo and your inbox. If you don't see a notification within 72 hours, please reach out to our support resources.







What is port eligibility?
Port eligibility is the process of verifying that your phone number is eligible to be transferred (or ported) from your existing wireless provider to 2600hz Mobile. This is also referred to as “Local Number Portability” (LNP). LNP number transfer can occur if the number is local to the service area where the transfer is to occur, and if 2600hz Mobile offers coverage in that area. If eligible, you may be able to transfer your existing wireless phone number to 2600hz Mobile.

Note: In order to transfer your existing phone number from another carrier to 2600hz Mobile, the number must be in active service with your current provider. Toll-free numbers are not eligible for a transfer.

How long will it take to port my phone number to 2600hz Mobile?
On average, transfers of mobile phone numbers take 2-24 hours. If you're transferring a land line or Google Voice number, it will take 5-7 days.

How will I know if there’s a problem with my number transfer?
Problems with number ports usually stem from information not matching up with your existing carrier. If we run into a problem while porting your phone number over to 2600hz Mobile, we'll email you to let you know.

What happens to my current wireless service after I transfer my wireless number to 2600hz Mobile?
Your account will automatically be cancelled.

Do I need to cancel my current service to complete the number transfer to 2600hz Mobile?
No, in order to transfer your phone number to 2600hz Mobile, your service must be active. After the number port has been completed, your previous carrier will automatically cancel your account.

Do I continue to pay my existing wireless provider while my number is being transferred to 2600hz Mobile?
Yes. Do not cancel your service while your phone number is in the process of porting to 2600hz Mobile. After the number has successfully ported to 2600hz Mobile we suggest that you call your old provider and ensure you will no longer be billed for that phone number.

Your number transfer form requires a password or PIN from my current carrier, but they didn't give me one. What should I do?
All of the fields in our number transfer form are required, but if there are pieces of information that your current carrier doesn't require to transfer your number, just enter something to fill in the field (i.e. 1234 for PIN or last four digits of SSN, or your phone number for account number). Since your current carrier isn't checking those fields, it doesn't matter what you enter in them.

What if I'm transferring a number that I had in another city or state?
If you move from New York, with a local number to Los Angeles, people calling you would be dialing a long distance New York number. So to be fair, if you move to another city or state, it might make sense to change your phone number so that people in your new town, city, etc., can reach you by making a local call.
